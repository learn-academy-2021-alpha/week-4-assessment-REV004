# ASSESSMENT 4: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is an instance variable in Ruby? How is it different from other variables?

Your answer:

Researched answer:An instance variable in ruby has a name starting with @ symbol, and its content is restricted to whatever the object itself refers to. Two separate objects, even though they belong to the same class, are allowed to have different values for their instance variables.

2. What is a block in Ruby?

Your answer: its a specific line of code that call only be called in that specified area

Researched answer:A Ruby block is a way of grouping statements, and may appear only in the source adjacent to a method call; the block is written starting on the same line as the method call's last parameter (or the closing parenthesis of the parameter list). The code in the block is not executed at the time it is encountered.

3. Ruby has an implicit return. What does that mean?

Your answer:

Researched answer:Any statement in Ruby returns the value of the last evaluated expression. A simple example is the getter method. We call a method and expect some value in return. But as we know, Ruby always returns the last evaluated expression.Sep 28, 2017

4. What is object-oriented programming? How is it different than functional programming?

Your answer:

Researched answer:Object oriented programming is a programming paradigm in which you program using objects to represent things you are programming about (sometimes real world things). These objects could be data structures. The objects hold data about them in attributes. The attributes in the objects are manipulated through methods or functions that are given to the object. the main difference is that OOP is executed in order while functional programming can be done in any order

5. What is the difference between a class and an object?

Your answer: a class is a whole set of information while an object is a a part of the class

Researched answer:A class is a blueprint from which you can create the instance, i.e., objects. An object is the instance of the class, which helps programmers to use variables and methods from inside the class.

6. STRETCH: What is `attr_accessor`?

Your answer:its made to be able to access certain items in a class

Researched answer:is a method called in a class

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

- MVC: Model–View–Controller is a software design pattern commonly used for developing user interfaces that divides the related program logic into three interconnected elements. This is done to separate internal representations of information from the ways information is presented to and accepted from the user
- PostgreSQL:It is a highly stable database management system, backed by more than 20 years of community development which has contributed to its high levels of resilience, integrity, and correctness. PostgreSQL is used as the primary data store or data warehouse for many web, mobile, geospatial, and analytics applications.
- API:API is the acronym for Application Programming Interface, which is a software intermediary that allows two applications to talk to each other. Each time you use an app like Facebook, send an instant message, or check the weather on your phone, you're using an API.
- CRUD:In computer programming, create, read, update, and delete are the four basic operations of persistent storage. Alternate words are sometimes used when defining the four basic operations of CRUD, such as construct instead of create, retrieve instead of read, or destroy or destruct instead of delete.
- Ruby on Rails:Ruby on Rails, or Rails, is a server-side web application framework written in Ruby under the MIT License. Rails is a model–view–controller framework, providing default structures for a database, a web service, and web pages
- ORM:ORM stands for Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) is a programming technique for converting data between relational databases and object oriented programming languages such as Java, C#, etc. Sr.No. Let's business code access objects rather than DB tables. Hides details of SQL queries from OO logic.
- Active Record: Active Record is the M in MVC - the model - which is the layer of the system responsible for representing business data and logic. Active Record facilitates the creation and use of business objects whose data requires persistent storage to a database.
